# Frontend Developer Test

Workout log
===========

You must implement a workout log using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The workout log should have these features:

* A place to insert workout items.
* A table with the items.
* A button to remove items.
* A counter with the total exercised hours.

## Mock

Please, follow [this mockup](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s6/sh/6db363ef-f8c1-4d8f-b619-b87889953cdc/ea1c6f7ebbc930e95f8012687fea9be6).

You should provide a workout log that works looks this mock, but remmember this is a mock and we are open to new ideas on how it should work.

## Requirements

* You should use HTML5 and modern frameworks like [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) or [Flight](http://twitter.github.com/flight/).
* The design is important but the UX is more important.
* You can surprise us but never forget the four main features.
* You don't need a backend, you can implement only in the browser using memory or local storage.
* You have to use git.
* You have to create a _private_ repository on Bitbucket or Github.
* Tests are welcome.

### General guidelines to follow:

- The final application provides a README file with instructions on how to run it? And how to run the tests?
- The solution works as it should be?
- All tasks were delivered? The applicant made something beyond the expected?
- Is the code easy to read?
- The code uses the common conventions of the used language?
- Did the applicant comprehended the problem as a whole?
- Did he structure/model the solution accordingly?
- The structure/architecture of the final application makes sense?
- The right tools for the solution were used? Or the applicant used a fork to have soup?
- Do you feel that the user was committed to deliver something really good?
- If you were asked to implement more features on the delivered application, would you rather keep the code or forget it and start the whole thing from scratch?
- The tests really describe the solution?
- Does he or she care about literate tests?
- Try to identify if the applicant did use of TDD/BDD.
- Look the repository log and check if the commits are tiny, with a well described purpose.
